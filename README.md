# Inflatio Analysis
## Statistical Analysis of Economic Indicators Project

### ctrl+s :v:

**Inflatio Analysis** is a prototype platform designed to analyze Brazil's economic indicators, with a special focus on inflation, using data from the [Central Bank API](https://www.bcb.gov.br/). Developed entirely in JavaScript at this initial stage, data is obtained on the frontend and processing is limited or basic, enabling the study of the browser's language and behaviors, in addition to simple local execution.

## Main Features

- **Execution in the Browser:** Implemented exclusively in JavaScript, the project works without the need for additional configurations, providing practicality and flexibility.

- **Integration with Central Bank API:** Uses a fetcher to obtain updated economic data directly from the Central Bank API, ensuring access to accurate and real-time information.

- **Basic Data Processing:** Performs basic calculations such as average and standard deviation using JavaScript on the frontend, in addition to visualizing data with Chart.js to generate interactive graphs, creating a simple and functional dashboard.

## Instructions for use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rmottanet/inflatio-analysis.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
3. Explore the features and carry out your economic analysis.
